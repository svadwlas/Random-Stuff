This is some Random Stuff we deal with every now and then!


1.) In one of the Java classes we checked to see the decrease in speeds, while using Reflection. It is almost always difficult to make a broad assumption in such cases, when so many aspects differ, from one scenario to another.


2.) An aspect is a common feature that's typically scattered across methods, classes, object hierarchies, or even entire object models. It is behavior that looks and smells like it should have structure, but you can't find a way to express this structure in code with traditional object-oriented techniques.
